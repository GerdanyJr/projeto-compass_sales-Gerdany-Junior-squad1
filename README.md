# Compass Sales

This project serves as an example application developed as part of the Compass UOL scholarship program. Its primary objective is to consolidate the knowledge acquired during the first 8 weeks of studying React Native. The application demonstrates a complete user authentication flow, including login, registration, and password recovery.

## Features

- **Login**: Users can securely log in using their email address and password.
- **Registration**: The registration process allows new users to create an account by providing their name, email address, and password.
- **Password Recovery**: Users can initiate a password reset by providing their email address, receiving a link via email to reset their password.
- **Social Media Login**: The app supports social media logins, allowing users to sign in using their Google or Facebook accounts.
- **Welcome Screen**: After a successful login, users are greeted with a personalized welcome screen that displays their name. They also have the option to log out.

## Used Libraries

This project utilizes the following libraries and technologies:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/): React Native is a popular JavaScript framework for building natively-rendered mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms. It enables developers to create mobile apps with a native look and feel while using React.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/): React Navigation is a highly regarded navigation library for React Native applications. It simplifies navigation and routing, offering features like stack navigation, tab navigation, and drawer navigation.
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/): React Hook Form is a library designed for managing forms and form validations in React applications. It streamlines form handling by utilizing React hooks, making form state and validation rules easy to manage.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Firebase is a comprehensive platform for developing web and mobile applications. In this project, Firebase is employed for user authentication, providing a secure and scalable authentication system. Users can sign in using email and password, Google, or Facebook accounts.
- [React Native FBSDK Next](https://github.com/thebergamo/react-native-fbsdk-next): React Native FBSDK is a wrapper around the iOS Facebook SDK and Android Facebook SDK, allowing for Facebook integration in React Native apps. Access to native components, from login to sharing, is provided entirely through documented JavaScript modules so you don't have to call a single native function directly.
- [React Native Google Sign In](https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin): The "react-native-google-signin" library is a popular library for integrating Google Sign-In functionality into React Native applications. It allows users to log in to your app using their Google accounts, which can enhance the user experience by simplifying the login process and providing access to user data from Google services.
